# FractalForest

This is the updated version of the [FractalForest](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fractal-forest.75850/) plugin that works with Java 16 and Minecraft 1.17+.

**Note: Support for the [Lands](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lands-land-claim-plugin-grief-prevention-protection-gui-management-nations-wars-1-17-support.53313/) plugin has been dropped since the LandsProtection.java class was having issues with the LandsAPI dependency (all other dependencies should still work). If anyone wants to take a shot at fixing it, I'll take a look and merge it to master if it works!**
